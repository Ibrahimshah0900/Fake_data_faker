# Fake Company Data for Analytics

## Project Description
This project generates a dataset simulating various aspects of a company, including employees, departments, revenue, and product sales. The data is created using the **Faker** library and analyzed using **Pandas**, with visualizations built using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. The goal is to provide realistic synthetic data for analytics and visualization purposes.

## Features
- **Employee Data**:
  - Fields: Employee ID, Name, Department, Position, Salary, Date of Joining.
  - Data saved in `employees.csv`.

- **Department Data**:
  - Fields: Department ID, Department Name, Number of Employees.
  - Data saved in `departments.csv`.

- **Revenue Data**:
  - Fields: Month, Total Revenue, Expenses, Profit.
  - Data saved in `revenue.csv`.

- **Product Sales Data**:
  - Fields: Product Name, Units Sold, Price, Revenue.
  - Data saved in `product_sales.csv`.

- **Visualizations**:
  - Employee count by department.
  - Monthly revenue vs. expenses.
  - Top 5 products by revenue.
